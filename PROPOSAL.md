MicroMage is a top-down, procedurally-generated, horror themed dungeon crawler using the LibGDX game development library. The goal is to use raycasting to create a limited field of view for the player, as they battle creatures during their descent into the dungeon. We plan to use multithreading to manage particle systems, menus and enemy entities.  

Our baseline goal is to include enemies with basic pathfinding A and attack patterns, and a way for the player to shoot or "cast" spells to defeat them. This will take place in a tile based level. As the battle goes on the player must keep their eye on their health and mana. Health is needed for survival and mana is to limmit the usage of the player's spell. The game will also feature basic sound effects.  

Ideally, our game will also feature a procedurally generated level design, giving the game some mild replay value. Spellbooks may be able to be collected for different spells that can be used against the enemies. As floors of the dungeon are completed, tilesets will be swapped out to make the visuals more interesting. We also plan to use a raycasting algorithm to create afield of view for the player, restricting their vision so enemies cannot be seen around corners, and adding difficulty to the navigation of the dungeon. We also want to add alternative ways of moving, possibly through rolling or sprinting.  

Some strech goals of ours is to add a particle system to the speels for better visuals, and an animated screen shake for certain events, like taking damage or castig certain spells. We also want to add music to the game and possibly a boss fight.
