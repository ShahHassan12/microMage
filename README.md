# microMage

MicroMage is  a top-down, procedurally-generated, horror themed dungeon crawler using the LibGDX game development library. The goal is to use raycasting to create a limited field of view for the player, as they battle creatures during their descent into the dungeon. We plan to use multithreading to manage particle systems, menus and enemy entities.
